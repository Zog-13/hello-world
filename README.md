# hello-world
My first repository
I setout with an idea to make a video game 5 days ago.
I learned quick that there are several free programs that can help accomplish this.
I also learned quick that I needed to learn how to code if I really wanted to do it.
Several google searches and videos later I learned of codecademy.
Three days ago I started on there taking notes and learning code.
I stumbled upon a video that mentioned the founder of FCC and followed his #1 rule since, "Code Everyday."
(Even if it's only an hour or two, at least I'm learning some [not to mention I love it]).
What's that line...If you do what you love, you'll never have to work again in your life.
